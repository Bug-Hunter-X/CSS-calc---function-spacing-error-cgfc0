# CSS calc() Spacing Issue

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  Incorrect spacing around operators can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors.

The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  This demonstrates the importance of precise spacing in CSS calculations.
